# text-based-football
Text based football game that can be played on Android devices (maybe later on the pc).

A project I started to develop because I couldn't find a football simulation on mobile like I wanted, in this game you can create players with the power you want and make them play against a random team or a team you created.

## TO DO
- [x] Make it run on Android
- [x] Basic football simulation
- [x] Show the events happening in the match
- [ ] Make an ending because it makes 0 sense rn
- [x] More events other than goal
- [ ] Match Half
- [ ] Team picker
- [x] Make it show score of match
- [ ] Offside system
- [ ] Photo of pitch on background
- [ ] Team squad for both teams
- [ ] Events list on middle down Squad list on left and right
- [ ] Match Start, Half, Finish Sounds
- [ ] Main menu
- [ ] Make squad editor
- [ ] Squad rotation changer
- [ ] Make the winner be determined by player ratings
- [ ] Randomized players with random ratings etc.
- [ ] Custom everything (team name - Pitch name)
